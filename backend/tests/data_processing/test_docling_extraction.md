## Cyber Range Technology Integrations

The SimSpace Platform supports most security/technology solutions and our experienced Professional Services team is ready to help when needed for more complex solutions.

This list is not all-inclusive, but does highlight some of the most prominent solutions that are currently or have previously been successfully deployed in ranges on the SimSpace platform.

## Operating Systems / Distributions:

- ● Android* (via emulator)
- ● Apple iOS* (via physical hardware)
- ● Apple MacOS (via physical hardware, but multiple MacOS VMs supported per device)
- ● CentOS
- ● Debian
- ● Fedora
- ● IBM Mainframe (virtualized or via physical hardware)
- ● Microsoft Windows Server (all major versions)
- ● Microsoft Windows Workstation (all major versions)
- ● OpenBSD
- ● Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)
- ● Red Hat Enterprise Linux

*NOTE: Android/iOS have previously been used in specific testing scenarios, but can be incorporated into a customer range if the need arises.

## Defensive/Offensive Security-oriented Distributions:

- ● Kali Linux
- ● Mandiant Commando VM
- ● Mandiant FLARE VM
- ● Metasploitable
- ● Parrot OS
- ● REMnux
- ● SANS SIFT Workstation

## Hardware-in-the-Loop:

The SimSpace platform fully supports hardware-in-theloop, allowing full range support for proprietary solutions or infrastructure appliances that are not virtualizable, such as:

- ● ICS/SCADA equipment
- ● Mainframe systems
- ● Mobile devices
- ● Network appliances

## Applications:

After installing an OS/distribution on a VM in the range, any applications supported by that OS can be installed on the VM.

- ● Saving a VM template for the finalized installation/config makes using that application more efficient in the future.

· For example, you can save a VM template of a Windows Server 2016 host that already has Microsoft Exchange installed and configured to your specifications.

- ● Refer to Appendix A for a reference list of commonly installed applications used in SimSpace cyber ranges.

## License Considerations

We are continually expanding our technology partnerships to make additional licenses available to SimSpace customers in our cyber ranges, and we support most security/tech solutions on the market if you would like to use your existing license(s).

## Bring Your Own License (BYOL):

- ● For any tools/solutions that we do not currently have licenses available, our Professional Services team is ready to assist with importing customer-supplied licenses.

## Free and Open-Source:

- ● The SimSpace platform allows custom software / solutions, including free and opensource solutions,  to be used in cyber ranges with many options available conveniently in our library.

## Microsoft Licenses:

- ● We are able to offer most OS versions / apps that are available via MSDN/Visual Studio.
- ● Our agreement currently only includes MS Office up to Office 2010.

## NFR Licenses:

- ● FireEye HX/NX/EX
- ● NetWitness (RSA)
- ● Qualys
- ● Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP)

## Full Licenses (limited quantity available):

- ● Bricata
- ● Cobalt Strike
- ● CrowdStrike*
- ● Nessus
- ● Palo Alto Firewall
- ● Splunk
- ● VMware Carbon Black*

*NOTE: Tools noted with * are currently a shared tenant under our license and are available for use on a check-in / check-out basis via Professional Services for prescheduled events / needs.
